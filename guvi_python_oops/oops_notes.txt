Object Oriented programming is a programming style that is associated with the concept of 
Class, Objects and various other concepts revolving around these two, like Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction, Encapsulation etc.

Class
Here we can take Human Being as a class. 
A class is a blueprint for any functional entity which defines its properties and its functions. 
Like Human Being, having body parts, and performing various actions.

class Vehnicle:     
        <statement-1>     
        .     
        .      
        <statement-N> 

Objects
My name is Dave, and I am an instance/object of class Male. 
When we say, Human Being, Male or Female, we just mean a kind, you, your friend, me we are the forms of these classes. We have a physical existence while a class is just a logical definition. We are the objects.

class car:  
    def __init__(self,modelname, year):     #fucntion 
        self.modelname = modelname  
        self.year = year   
    def display(self):                 #function 
        print(self.modelname,self.year)  
  
tata = car("tata indica","1999")

hyundai = car("creta","2015")

bmw = car("x3","2001")

c1.display()  


def: The keyword is used to define function.
__init__() Method: It is a reserved method. This method gets called as soon as an object of a class is instantiated.
self:   The first argument self refers to the current object. 
        It binds the instance to the __init__() method. 
        Itâ€™s usually named self to follow the naming convention.



Inheritance:
Considering HumanBeing a class, which has properties like hands, legs, eyes etc, and functions like walk, talk, eat, see etc. 
Male and Female are also classes, but most of the properties and functions are included in HumanBeing, hence they can inherit everything from class HumanBeing using the concept of Inheritance.


Abstraction:
Abstraction means, showcasing only the required things to the outside world while hiding the details. 
Human Being's can talk, walk, hear, eat, but the details are hidden from the outside world


Encapsulation:
This binding of the properties to functions is called Encapsulation.


Polymorphism:
Polymorphism, or Poly + Morph, means "many forms
Polymorphism is a concept, which allows us to redefine the way something works, by either changing how it is done or by changing the parts using which it is done
