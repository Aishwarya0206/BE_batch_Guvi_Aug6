A constructor is a special method used to create and initialize an object of a class. 
This method is defined in the class.

The constructor is executed automatically at the time of object creation.
The primary use of a constructor is to declare and initialize data member/ instance variables of a class. 
The constructor contains a collection of statements (i.e., instructions) that executes at the time of object creation to initialize the attributes of an object.

syntax:
------

def __init__(self):
    # body of the constructor


def: The keyword is used to define function.
__init__() Method: It is a reserved method. This method gets called as soon as an object of a class is instantiated.
self:   The first argument self refers to the current object. 
        It binds the instance to the __init__() method. 
        Itâ€™s usually named self to follow the naming convention.
